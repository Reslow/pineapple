A new fidget was designed through brainstorming activities and a lot of sketching. Penelope is a case for a pencil, the case is built up from different modules which can spin and have various materials and colors. 
These modules create a case like a jewelry for the pencil. The modules wake curiosity and give people something to do when people are still and need to focus like in a classroom. Penelope can change in look due to the different modules and the material is organic and ecofriendly.

The project started with three solutions on fidgets that could entertain a person silently during a meeting and not to disturb too much. I started a brainstorming session based on one question, 1. What do you do when you do nothing?

This product design has been created through different brainstorming techniques, Sketches and defining product material, brand, market, persona and more.  To develop a new fidget, I started with brainstorming and sketching on three types of fidget ideas, Then I chosed the fidget idea that was most promising.  Then I started sketching on look and feel of the fidget on side of searching for information about similar products.  The Penelope fidget became the result as a pen accessory for younger students.
