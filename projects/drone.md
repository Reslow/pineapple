This image above has been redesigned after the Project by me,  No larger Changes has been made, movement of Icons and small Changes of Icons has been made. 


The project was given by The Swedish forest agency. In this project I worked with four other students for five weeks. During this time, we developed a design of an interface for a mobile application that helps forest workers to plan and overview the forest. 

The Swedish forest agency want to motivate more workers to use drones in their workday.  It is important to develop an interface that forest workers understand. First larger goal was to create an interface that is “foresty”.  In the future the Swedish forest agency had a plan to teach an AI to recognize items from images and later be able to fly over forests and identify objects. 

With the design of the interface We wanted to leave design space that allows further development for functions that will be needed in the future with the AI.  Our main goal was to create a design that the workers can and want to use. To succeed in the project, we worked with user centered design methods and iterated through a conceptual faze and a processing faze. 

We conducted a study where we met a user and a expert on flying drones in the forest industry. We did an interview with observations and think aloud technique.   In the study we learned about the importance of feeling control and there is a need for simplifying the interface and options of micro functionality. 

After the study we wrote down and discussed out thoughts in an affinity diagram.   Then We started creating our first concept. The concept was presented for validation. We did a user test where we presented a paper prototype to a potential user and asked questions of his understanding of the interface.  The test got us a lot of knowledge about perception of interface elements. We redesigned and then started on building an interactive prototype in Axure RP.

## The process ##
This design process was user centered and we used two type of workshops to define a problem area
and a solution, we invited students as participants in the study because they are one of the two important users in this scenario.

## The Concept ##
My Forest drone app has two main functions, first one is flying and controlling the drone, second is tagging objects for work purposes. We worked with the most critical information needed for flying, such as battery strength, height of drone and direction of the drone. We also added functions like tagging a object while flying for supporting the work tasks. We also added diffrent map layers because it is useful in their practice, The map layers view diffrent information
