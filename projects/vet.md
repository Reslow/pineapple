During 9 weeks me and three other students researched about how vets diagnose cancer in dogs, to design an application which could visualize result from a rapid test. We worked with a company which had a new technique of measuring blood, the new technique makes it possible to catch some types of cancer in an earlier stage. To understand how we could motivate vets to use this new application we wanted to understand how vets accept new products. According to our research, acceptance is build on the users background and experience and teh perceived usefulness and usability of the product.

The data gathering resultet in identification of factors which affect vets acceptance of the application. It is important with specificity in the test, We also found that the image of the company behind the product is important. The interface needs to be simple and only have the function needed for the vets to reach their goal.

use of application

1.Take a blood sample and drop blod on the rapid test.

2.Wait 10 minutes and then they point the mobile camera towards

the rapid test

3.The screen will show result that can be transfered to the journal.
