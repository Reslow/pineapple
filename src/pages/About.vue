    <p>As a UX designer I am always focused on the user, what the user wants and more important the users needs. I am a good listener and I think I am good at shifting perspectives when thinking of design, this give more depth to the thoughts behind the design. I know how to conduct user research and how to produce products depending on user research. In june 2019 I will take my bachelor in interaction design at Linneaus University. I have been working with the design process from idea to interactive prototypes in various projects during my education</p>
